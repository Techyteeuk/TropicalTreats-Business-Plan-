# TropicalTreats Business Plan & Business Concept Overview

The plan is to establish a mobile coffee stand with a unique twist: offering Jamaican patties and cakes alongside coffee, all priced affordably. Additionally, the business aims to prioritize eco-friendliness by operating as a net-zero company. This involves utilizing solar-powered portable power stations, implementing a water system that recycles water to reduce waste, composting organic materials like coffee grounds and fruit, and maximizing recycling efforts. By operating as a self-contained, off-the-grid business, the goal is to minimize the carbon footprint.

## Customers

The primary target demographic includes commuters in the morning and individuals seeking quick snacks or pick-me-ups throughout the day. With the growing trend of coffee and tea consumption, especially with an average of three cups per day per person, there is a significant market for pop-up stands offering convenient "grab-and-go" services.

## Premises Ideas

1. Purchase a long wheelbase van (such as a Sprinter, VW, or Luton low loader) ranging from £2,500 to £15,000 and proceed with a self-built and retrofitted van.

2. Acquire a used box trailer priced between £560 to £5,000 and proceed with a self-built and retrofitted trailer.

### Options to consider

- **A)** Opt for any van and undertake a self-build approach, which presents both advantages and challenges. While this method can be more cost-effective, expenses may escalate based on desired aesthetics and material choices. Assuming a £3,000 budget for van purchase and an additional £2,000 for interior and exterior renovations, the total investment would amount to £5,000. Alternatively, consider purchasing a pre-built van conversion, which typically costs around £8,000 for a basic setup.

- **B)** Consider any box/horsebox trailer for a self-built conversion, weighing the cost-effectiveness against potential expenses. With a £3,000 budget for trailer acquisition and an additional £1,100 for necessary modifications, the total investment would be £1,950, resulting in savings of £1,050 compared to the van option. Alternatively, explore pre-built box trailer conversions, which typically range around £5,000 for a quality setup.
